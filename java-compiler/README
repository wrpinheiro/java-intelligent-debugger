This module generates the source code for a Java Compiler based on Java Language Grammar 1.5

Description
===========

The SableCC (http://sablecc.org/) is used to generate the classes of the compiler based on
a grammar of Java 1.5 language with a small change to include a new keyword iif. This 
keyword is used to replace while and do/while statements in the AST with a sequence os nested
iif's. This approach is used to make easier the construction of the Value Based Model need to
perform the diagnosis.

TODO: Make refs. to the previously cited concepts.


How to Build
============

This project uses a Maven plugin for SableCC that makes easy to generate the compiler classes,
the compilation and packing of all resources. To do this, just use:

  'mvn package' or 'mvn install'

This project only depends on SableCC libraries to generated the source.
